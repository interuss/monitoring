When this location resolves to artifacts that are not\nTestSuiteReports, those artifacts will be ignored.\n\nNote that capabilities are verified in the order they are defined.  So, if capability B defined in a particular\nlocation depends on whether capability A in that same location is granted, capability A must be defined before\ncapability B is defined.  Also note that capability verifications are computed as test components are completed.\nSince a parent test component (e.g., test suite) is not complete until all of its child components are complete, a\ndescendant test component's capability condition cannot depend on whether an ancestor's (e.g., parent's) capability\nis verified."
