# Monitoring

This folder contains various tools to monitor, diagnose, and troubleshoot UTM
systems including DSS instances and systems that interact with DSS instances.

## Nominal system

When deployed normally in production, a remote ID ecosystem should look
like this:

![Nominal RID system](../assets/nominal_rid_system.png)

The tools in this folder test, mock, or implement components of this system.

## Diagnostic tools

### atproxy

[atproxy](atproxy) exposes automated testing endpoints that can be implemented
by calling other exposed handler endpoints.  This means that the automated
testing implementation of a USS can make only outgoing calls to atproxy, which
can be hosted in an entirely differently location than the automated testing
implementation.

### load_test

![DSS load test system](../assets/load_test_system.png)

The [DSS load test](loadtest) sends a large number of concurrent requests to a
DSS instance to ensure it handles the load effectively.

### prober

![prober system](../assets/prober_system.png)

[prober](prober) is an DSS integration test that performs a sequence of
operations on a single DSS instance and ensures that the expected results are
observed.

### uss_qualifier

![uss_qualifier system with RID](../assets/rid_qualifier_system.png)

[uss_qualifier](uss_qualifier/README.md) is an automated test suite intended to verify
correct functionality of USSs, including an entire RID ecosystem by injecting known test data
into one or more RID Service Providers, observing the resulting system state via
one or more RID Display Providers, and verifying that the expected results were
observed.  It is intended to be run in a production-like shared test environment
to verify the interoperability of all participants' systems before promoting
any system changes to production.

## Mock systems

### dev DSS

`make start-locally` (or [build/dev/run_locally.sh](../build/dev/run_locally.sh))
brings up a local development DSS including a
[Dummy OAuth server](https://github.com/interuss/dss/tree/master/cmds/dummy-oauth)
which grants properly-formatted access tokens (which can be validated against the
[test public key](../build/test-certs/auth2.pem)) to anyone requesting them.

### mock_uss

#### ridsp

![mock_ridsp system](../assets/mock_ridsp_system.png)

The [mock RID Service Provider](mock_uss) behaves like an RID Service Provider
which accepts input flight data (as would normally come from an operator) via
the
[InterUSS RID automated testing interface](../interfaces/automated_testing/rid)
injection API.

#### riddp

![mock_riddp system](../assets/mock_riddp_system.png)

The [mock RID Display Provider](mock_uss) behaves like an RID Display Provider
that makes remote ID information available to Display Application substitutes
via the
[InterUSS RID automated testing interface](../interfaces/automated_testing/rid)
observation API.

#### tracer

![tracer](../assets/tracer_system.png)

[tracer](mock_uss) is a diagnostic tool that acts like an RID Display Provider
and strategic coordination USS order to collect and present information about
the state of the system.  It is not compliant with the data protection
requirements of the ASTM standards and therefore may not be used in any
production systems.
