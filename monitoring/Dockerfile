# Dockerfile for interuss/monitoring
#
# The image generated by this Dockerfile (via ./build.sh) includes the entire
# `monitoring` folder contents in /app/monitoring and has installed dependencies
# necessary to run any of the monitoring tools.  See documentation for any of
# the applicable tools for instructions on how to use the generated image.  A
# search for "interuss/monitoring" within the repository should yield most of
# the places where this image is in use.
#
# This image is intended to be built from the repository root context/folder.
