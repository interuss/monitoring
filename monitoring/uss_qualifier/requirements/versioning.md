# Versioning and version reporting requirements

InterUSS requires (<tt>ReportSystemVersion</tt>) a USS to report the version of a system with an identity known by the test designer and all participants during the execution of a test where that version is important to the test.  If the participant does not respond appropriately according to the means by which uss_qualifier obtains the version (specified by the test designer for the participant), the participant has not met this requirement.  Currently, the only means by which a participant can report a system version is by implementing the [InterUSS automated testing versioning interface](https://github.com/interuss/automated_testing_interfaces/tree/main/versioning).  The system identity should be a string agreed upon by the test designer and participants before tests are conducted.
