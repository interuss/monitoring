# ASTM F3411-22a NetRID DSS interoperability test scenario

## Overview

The test scenario in this folder verifies that two DSS instances implementing
the API required by ASTM F3411-22a in a shared DSS region  interoperate
correctly.  This is generally accomplished by performing an  operation on one
DSS instance and then verifying that the results are visible  in the other
instance.  Neither of the two DSS instances need to be an InterUSS Platform
implementation.

## Resources

### primary_dss_instance

A resources.astm.f3411.DSSInstanceResource containing the "primary" DSS instance for this scenario.

### all_dss_instances

A resources.astm.f3411.DSSInstancesResource containing at least two DSS instances complying with ASTM F3411-22a.

### test_exclusions

A [resources.dev.TestExclusionsResource](../../../../resources/dev/test_exclusions.py) containing test exclusions parameters like whether private addresses are allowed.
This resource is optional.

## Test sequence legend

* *P*: Primary DSS instance under test.  The sequence below is
intended to be repeated so that each DSS is the primary DSS under test for one
iteration of the sequence.
* *n*: Each of the other (non-Primary) DSS instances.
* ISA[*id*]: Reference to Identification Service Area with a particular test id
(test id index, not full UUID identifier).  Note that the same UUID should be
used for ISA[i] throughout the sequence even though the logical ISA may be
created and deleted multiple times.
* Subscription[*id*]: Reference to Subscription with a particular test *id*
(test id index, not full UUID identifier).  Note that the same UUID should be
used for Subscription[i] throughout the sequence even though the logical
Subscription may be created and deleted multiple times.
* D: Number of seconds needed to process requests to all DSS instances before
the note to wait >D seconds from a particular time

## Prerequisites test case

### Test environment requirements test step

#### ðŸ›‘ DSS instance is publicly addressable check
As per **[astm.f3411.v22a.DSS0210](../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)** the DSS instance should be publicly addressable.
As such, this check will fail if the resolved IP of the DSS host is a private IP address.
This check is skipped if the test exclusion `allow_private_addresses` is set to `True`.

#### DSS instance is reachable check
As per **[astm.f3411.v22a.DSS0210](../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)** the DSS instance should be publicly addressable.
As such, this check will fail if the DSS is not reachable with a dummy query,
