# ASTM NetRID DSS: Subscription Simple test scenario

## Overview

Perform basic operations on a single DSS instance to create, update and delete subscriptions.

## Resources

### dss

[`DSSInstanceResource`](../../../../../resources/astm/f3411/dss.py) to be tested in this scenario.

### id_generator

[`IDGeneratorResource`](../../../../../resources/interuss/id_generator.py) providing the Subscription IDs for this scenario.

### isa

[`ServiceAreaResource`](../../../../../resources/netrid/service_area.py) describing a service area for which to subscribe.

### problematically_big_area

[`VerticesResource`](../../../../../resources/vertices.py) describing an area designed to be too big to be accepted by the DSS.

### client_identity

[`ClientIdentityResource`](../../../../../resources/communications/client_identity.py) to be used for this scenario.

## Setup test case

### [Ensure clean workspace test step](test_steps/clean_workspace.md)

This step ensures that no subscription with the known test ID exists in the DSS.

## Subscription Simple test case

This test case creates multiple subscriptions, goes on to query and search for them, then deletes and searches for them again.

### Create subscription validation test step

This test step creates multiple subscriptions with different combinations of the optional end and start time parameters.

All subscriptions are left on the DSS when this step ends, as they are expected to be present for the subsequent step.

#### Create subscription check

As per **[astm.f3411.v22a.DSS0030,c](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)**, the DSS API must allow callers to create a subscription with either onr or both of the
start and end time missing, provided all the required parameters are valid.

#### Response to subscription creation contains a subscription check

As per **[astm.f3411.v22a.DSS0030,c](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)**, upon creation of a subscription,
the newly created subscription must be part of its response.

#### Returned subscription has an ID check

If the returned subscription has no ID, **[astm.f3411.v22a.DSS0030,c](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)** is not respected.

#### Returned subscription ID is correct check

If the returned subscription ID does not correspond to the one specified in the creation parameters,
**[astm.f3411.v22a.DSS0030,c](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)** is not respected.

#### Returned subscription has an owner check

If the returned subscription has no owner set, **[astm.f3411.v22a.DSS0030,c](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)** is not respected.

#### Returned subscription owner is correct check

If the returned subscription's owner does not correspond to the uss_qualifier, **[astm.f3411.v22a.DSS0030,c](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)** is not respected.

#### Returned notification index is 0 if present check

The notification index of a newly created subscription must be 0, otherwise the DSS is in violation of **[astm.f3411.v22a.DSS0030,c](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)**.

#### Returned subscription has an ISA URL check

If the returned subscription has no ISA URL defined, **[astm.f3411.v22a.DSS0030,c](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)** is not respected.

#### Returned ISA URL has correct base URL check

The returned ISA URL must be prefixed with the USS base URL that was provided at subscription creation, otherwise the DSS is in violation of **[astm.f3411.v22a.DSS0030,c](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)**.

#### Returned subscription has a start time check

If the returned subscription has no start time defined, **[astm.f3411.v22a.DSS0030,c](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)** is not respected.

#### Returned start time is correct check

The returned start time must be the same as the provided one, otherwise the DSS is in violation of **[astm.f3411.v22a.DSS0030,c](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)**.

#### Returned subscription has an end time check

Subscriptions need a defined end time in order to limit their duration: if the DSS omits to set the end time, it will be in violation of **[astm.f3411.v22a.DSS0060](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)**.

#### Returned end time is correct check

The returned end time must be the same as the provided one, otherwise the DSS is in violation of **[astm.f3411.v22a.DSS0030,c](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)**.

#### Returned subscription has a version check

If the returned subscription has no version defined, **[astm.f3411.v22a.DSS0030,c](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)** is not respected.

#### Generated subscription version has proper format check

The subscription version generated by the DSS must be a lower-case alphanumeric string of 10 characters or more, otherwise the DSS is in violation of **[astm.f3411.v22a.DSS0030,c](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)**.

### Query Existing Subscription test step

Query and search for the created subscription in various ways

#### Get Subscription by ID check

### Mutate Subscription test step

This test step mutates the previously created subscription to verify that the DSS reacts properly: notably, it checks that the subscription version is updated,
including for changes that are not directly visible, such as changing the subscription's footprint.

#### Subscription can be mutated check

If a subscription cannot be modified with a valid set of parameters, the DSS is failing to meet **[astm.f3411.v22a.DSS0030,c](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)**.

### Query Deleted Subscription test step

Attempt to query and search for the deleted subscription in various ways

#### Query by subscription ID should fail check

If the DSS provides a successful reply to a direct query for the deleted subscription, it is in violation of **[astm.f3411.v22a.DSS0030,e](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)**.

#### Search for all subscriptions in ISA area check

If the DSS fails to let us search in the area for which the subscription was just created, it is failing to meet **[astm.f3411.v22a.DSS0030,f](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)**.

#### Search area that represents a loop is not allowed check

The DSS should not allow us to search for subscriptions using a list of vertices describing a loop (first and last points in the list of vertices are the same),
otherwise it is failing to meet **[astm.f3411.v22a.DSS0030,f](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)**.

#### Deleted subscription should not be present in search results check

If the DSS returns the deleted subscription in a search that covers the area it was originally created for, the DSS is not properly implementing **[astm.f3411.v22a.DSS0030,f](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)**.

## Cleanup

The cleanup phase of this test scenario removes the subscription with the known test ID if it has not been removed before.

#### Subscription can be queried by ID check

If the DSS cannot be queried for the existing test ID, the DSS is likely not implementing **[astm.f3411.v22a.DSS0030,e](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)** correctly.

#### Subscription can be deleted check

An attempt to delete a subscription when the correct version is provided should succeed, otherwise the DSS is in violation of **[astm.f3411.v22a.DSS0030,d](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)**.
