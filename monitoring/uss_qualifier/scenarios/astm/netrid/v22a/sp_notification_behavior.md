# ASTM NetRID Service Provider notification behavior test scenario

## Overview

In this scenario, a single nominal flight is injected into each NetRID Service Provider (SP) under test, after a subscription was created on the DSS.

The SP is expected to properly notify the owner of the Subscription.

## Resources

### flights_data

A [`FlightDataResource`](../../../../resources/netrid/flight_data.py) containing 1 nominal flight per SP under test.

### service_providers

A set of [`NetRIDServiceProviders`](../../../../resources/netrid/service_providers.py) to be tested via the injection of RID flight data.  This scenario requires at least one SP under test.

### mock_uss

MockUSSResource for testing notification delivery.

### dss_pool

A [`DSSInstancesResource`](../../../../resources/astm/f3411/dss.py) from which a DSS will be picked and on which a Subscription will be created.

### id_generator

[`IDGeneratorResource`](../../../../resources/interuss/id_generator.py) providing the Subscription ID for this scenario.

## Setup test case

### [Clean workspace test step](./dss/test_steps/clean_workspace.md)

## Service Provider notification behavior test case

### Mock USS Subscription test step

Before injecting the test flights, a subscription is created on the DSS for the configured mock USS to allow it
to validate that the Service Providers under test correctly send out notifications.

#### 🛑 Subscription creation succeeds check

As per **[astm.f3411.v22a.DSS0030,c](../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)**, the DSS API must allow callers to create a subscription with either one or both of the
start and end time missing, provided all the required parameters are valid.

### [Injection test step](./fragments/flight_injection.md)

In this step, uss_qualifier injects a single nominal flight into each SP under test, usually with a start time in the future.  Each SP is expected to queue the provided telemetry and later simulate that telemetry coming from an aircraft at the designated timestamps.

### Validate Mock USS received notification test step

This test step verifies that the mock_uss for which a subscription was registered before flight injection properly received a notification from each Service Provider
at which a flight was injected.

#### [Get mock_uss interactions](../../../interuss/mock_uss/get_mock_uss_interactions.md)

#### ⚠️ Service Provider issued a notification check

This check validates that each Service Provider at which a test flight was injected properly notified the mock_uss.

If this is not the case, the respective Service Provider fails to meet **[astm.f3411.v22a.NET0740](../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)**.

#### ⚠️ Service Provider notification was received within delay check

This check validates that the notification from each Service Provider was received by the mock_uss within the specified delay.

**[astm.f3411.v22a.NET0740](../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v22a.md)** states that a Service Provider must notify the owner of a subscription within `NetDpDataResponse95thPercentile` (1 second) second 95% of the time and `NetDpDataResponse99thPercentile` (3 seconds) 99% of the time as soon as the SP becomes aware of the subscription.

This check will be failed if it takes longer than 3 seconds between the injection of the flight and the notification being received by the mock_uss.

## Cleanup

The cleanup phase of this test scenario attempts to remove injected data from all SPs.

### ⚠️ Successful test deletion check

**[interuss.automated_testing.rid.injection.DeleteTestSuccess](../../../../requirements/interuss/automated_testing/rid/injection.md)**

### [Clean Subscriptions](./dss/test_steps/clean_workspace.md)

Remove all created subscriptions from the DSS.
