# Create or update ISA test step fragment

This page describes the content of a common test step where a creation or an update of an ISA should be successful.
See `DSSWrapper.put_isa` in [`dss_wrapper.py`](../../../dss_wrapper.py).

## ℹ️ ISA response code check

The API for **[astm.f3411.v19.DSS0030,a](../../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v19.md)** specifies that the code of successful DSS responses is 200. While tolerated in some cases, if the DSS responds with an HTTP code 201 for success, this check will fail with a low severity.

## ⚠️ ISA response format check

The API for **[astm.f3411.v19.DSS0030,a](../../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v19.md)** specifies an explicit format that the DSS responses must follow.  If the DSS response does not validate against this format, this check will fail.

## ⚠️ ISA ID matches check

When the ISA is created, the DSS returns the ID of the ISA in the response body.  If this ID does not match the ID in the resource path, **[astm.f3411.v19.DSS0030,a](../../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v19.md)** was not implemented correctly and this check will fail.

## ⚠️ ISA version changed check

When the ISA is updated, the DSS returns the updated version of the ISA in the response body.  If this version remains the same as the one before the update, **[astm.f3411.v19.DSS0030,a](../../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v19.md)** was not implemented correctly and this check will fail.

## ⚠️ ISA version format check

Because the ISA version must be used in URLs, it must be URL-safe even though the ASTM standards do not explicitly require this.  If the indicated ISA version is not URL-safe, this check will fail.

## ⚠️ ISA start time matches check

The ISA creation request specified an exact start time slightly past now, so the DSS should have created an ISA starting at exactly that time.  If the DSS response indicates the ISA start time is not this value, **[astm.f3411.v19.DSS0030,a](../../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v19.md)** is not implemented correctly and this check will fail.

## ⚠️ ISA end time matches check

The ISA creation request specified an exact end time, so the DSS should have created an ISA ending at exactly that time.  If the DSS response indicates the ISA end time is not this value, **[astm.f3411.v19.DSS0030,a](../../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v19.md)** is not implemented correctly and this check will fail.

## ⚠️ ISA URL matches check

When the ISA is created, the DSS returns the URL of the ISA in the response body.  If this URL does not match the URL requested, **[astm.f3411.v19.DSS0030,a](../../../../../../requirements/astm/f3411/v19.md)** is not implemented correctly and this check will fail.
