# ASTM F3411-19 NetRID DSS interoperability test scenario

## Overview

The test scenario in this folder verifies that two DSS instances implementing
the API required by ASTM F3411-19 in a shared DSS region  interoperate
correctly.  This is generally accomplished by performing an  operation on one
DSS instance and then verifying that the results are visible  in the other
instance.  Neither of the two DSS instances need to be an InterUSS Platform
implementation.

## Resources

### dss_instances

A resources.astm.f3411.DSSInstancesResource containing at least two DSS instances complying with ASTM F3411-19.  The first instance is the "Primary DSS" instance and the other instances are the "Other DSS" instances.

## Test sequence legend

* *P*: Primary DSS instance under test.  The sequence below is
  intended to be repeated so that each DSS is the primary DSS under test for one
  iteration of the sequence.
* *n*: Each of the other (non-Primary) DSS instances.
* ISA[*id*]: Reference to Identification Service Area with a particular test id
  (test id index, not full UUID identifier).  Note that the same UUID should be
  used for ISA[i] throughout the sequence even though the logical ISA may be
  created and deleted multiple times.
* Subscription[*id*]: Reference to Subscription with a particular test *id*
  (test id index, not full UUID identifier).  Note that the same UUID should be
  used for Subscription[i] throughout the sequence even though the logical
  Subscription may be created and deleted multiple times.
* D: Number of seconds needed to process requests to all DSS instances before
  the note to wait >D seconds from a particular time
