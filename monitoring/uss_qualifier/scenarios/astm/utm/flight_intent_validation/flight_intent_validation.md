# Validation of operational intents test scenario

## Description
This test checks that the USS validates correctly the operational intents it creates.
Notably the following requirements:
- **[astm.f3548.v21.OPIN0015](../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**
- **[astm.f3548.v21.OPIN0020](../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**
- **[astm.f3548.v21.OPIN0030](../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**
- **[astm.f3548.v21.OPIN0040](../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**
- **[astm.f3548.v21.GEN0500](../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**

It assumes that the area used in the scenario is already clear of any pre-existing flights (using, for instance, PrepareFlightPlanners scenario).

## Resources
### flight_intents
FlightIntentsResource that provides the following flight intents:
- `valid_flight`: a valid operational intent upon which other invalid ones are derived, in `Accepted` state
  - `valid_activated`: state mutation `Activated`
  - `invalid_too_far_away`: reference time mutation: reference time pulled back so that it is like the operational intent is attempted to be planned more than OiMaxPlanHorizon = 30 days ahead of time
  - `valid_conflict_tiny_overlap`: volumes mutation: has a volume that overlaps with `valid_op_intent` just above IntersectionMinimumPrecision = 1cm in a way that must result as a conflict

Because the scenario involves activation of intents, all activated intents must be active during the execution of the
test scenario. Additionally, their end time must leave sufficient time for the execution of the test scenario. For the
sake of simplicity, it is recommended to set the start and end times of all the intents to the same range.

### tested_uss
FlightPlannerResource that will be tested for its validation of operational intents.

### dss
DSSInstanceResource that provides access to a DSS instance where flight creation/sharing can be verified.

## Attempt to plan invalid flight intents test case
### Attempt to plan flight intent too far ahead of time test step
The user flight intent that the test driver attempts to plan has a reference time that is more than
OiMaxPlanHorizon = 30 days ahead of time from the actual intent. As such, the planning attempt should be rejected.

#### Incorrectly planned check
If the USS successfully plans the flight or otherwise fails to indicate a rejection, it means that it failed to validate
the intent provided.  Therefore, this check will fail if the USS indicates success in creating the flight from the user
flight intent, per **[astm.f3548.v21.OPIN0030](../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**.

#### Failure check
All flight intent data provided was complete and correct. It should have been processed successfully, allowing the USS
to reject or accept the flight. If the USS indicates that the injection attempt failed, this check will fail per
**[interuss.automated_testing.flight_planning.ExpectedBehavior](../../../../requirements/interuss/automated_testing/flight_planning.md)**.

### [Validate flight intent too far ahead of time not planned test step](../validate_not_shared_operational_intent.md)

## Validate transition to Ended state after cancellation test case
### [Plan flight intent test step](../../../flight_planning/plan_flight_intent.md)
The valid flight intent should be successfully planned by the flight planner.

### [Validate flight intent shared correctly test step](../validate_shared_operational_intent.md)
Validate that the flight intent was shared correctly and is discoverable.

### [Cancel flight intent test step](../../../flight_planning/delete_flight_intent.md)
The flight intent should be successfully transition to Ended state by the flight planner.

### Validate flight intent is non-discoverable test step

#### DSS responses check

If the DSS fails to reply to a query concerning operational intent references in a given area,
it is in violation of **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,2](../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**, and this check will fail.

#### Operational intent not shared check
If the operational intent is still discoverable after it was transitioned to Ended,
this check will fail per **[astm.f3548.v21.OPIN0040](../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**.

## Validate precision of intersection computations test case
### [Plan control flight intent test step](../../../flight_planning/plan_flight_intent.md)
The valid control flight intent should be successfully planned by the flight planner.

### Attempt to plan flight conflicting by a tiny overlap test step
The tested USS is instructed to plan a flight that is constructed in a way that it intersects by just over IntersectionMinimumPrecision = 1 cm.

#### Incorrectly planned check
If the tested USS successfully plans the flight or otherwise fails to indicate a rejection, it means that it failed
to correctly compute the conflicting intersection. Therefore, this check will fail if the USS indicates success in
planning the flight from the user flight intent, per **[astm.f3548.v21.GEN0500](../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**.

#### Failure check
All flight intent data provided was complete and correct. It should have been processed successfully, allowing the USS
to reject or accept the flight. If the USS indicates that the injection attempt failed, this check will fail per
**[interuss.automated_testing.flight_planning.ExpectedBehavior](../../../../requirements/interuss/automated_testing/flight_planning.md)**.

## Cleanup
### Successful flight deletion check
