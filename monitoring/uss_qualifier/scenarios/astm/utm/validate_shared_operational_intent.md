# Validate flight sharing test step fragment

This step verifies that a created flight is shared properly per ASTM F3548-21 by querying the DSS for flights in the area of the flight intent, and then retrieving the details from the USS if the operational intent reference is found.  See `OpIntentValidator.expect_shared()` in [test_steps.py](test_steps.py).

## 🛑 DSS responses check

**[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005](../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**

## 🛑 Operational intent shared correctly check

If a reference to the operational intent for the flight is not found in the DSS, this check will fail per **[astm.f3548.v21.USS0005](../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)** and **[astm.f3548.v21.OPIN0025](../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**.

## 🛑 Operational intent for active flight not deleted check

If an activated operational intent is expected to exist after it has been modified or activated and that it is not found
in the DSS, this means that there is an active flight without a corresponding operational intent, then this check will
fail per **[interuss.automated_testing.flight_planning.FlightCoveredByOperationalIntent](../../../requirements/interuss/automated_testing/flight_planning.md)**.

## 🛑 Operational intent details retrievable check

If the operational intent details for the flight cannot be retrieved from the USS, this check will fail per **[astm.f3548.v21.USS0105](../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)** and **[astm.f3548.v21.OPIN0025](../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**.

## ⚠️ Operational intent details data format check

If the operational intent details response does not validate against [the GetOperationalIntentDetailsResponse schema of the OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/astm-utm/Protocol/blob/v1.0.0/utm.yaml#L1120), this check fill fail per **[astm.f3548.v21.USS0105](../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**.

## 🛑 Correct operational intent details check

If the operational intent details reported by the USS do not match the user's flight intent, this check will fail per **[interuss.automated_testing.flight_planning.ExpectedBehavior](../../../requirements/interuss/automated_testing/flight_planning.md)** and **[astm.f3548.v21.OPIN0025](../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**.

## ⚠️ Off-nominal volumes check

**[astm.f3548.v21.OPIN0015](../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)** specifies that nominal operational intents (Accepted and Activated) must not include any off-nominal 4D volumes, so this check will fail if an Accepted or Activated operational intent includes off-nominal volumes.

## ⚠️ Vertices check

**[astm.f3548.v21.OPIN0020](../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**
