# ASTM SCD DSS: Interfaces authentication test scenario

## Overview

Ensures that a DSS properly authenticates requests to all its endpoints.

Note that this does not cover authorization.

## Resources

### dss

[`DSSInstanceResource`](../../../../../resources/astm/f3548/v21/dss.py) to be tested in this scenario.

Note that to benefit from the maximum coverage, the DSS' AuthAdapterResource must be able to obtain credentials
for multiple scopes (so that a wrong scope may be used in place of the correct one) as well as an empty scope
(that is, provide credentials where the scope is an empty string).

This scenario will check for the scope's availability and transparently ignore checks that can't be conducted.

At least one of the following scopes needs to be available for this scenario to at least partially run:

- `utm.strategic_coordination`
- `utm.availability_arbitration`
- `utm.constraint_management`

In order to verify each endpoint group, all scopes above must be available.

Optional scopes that will allow the scenario to provide additional coverage:

- `""` (empty string)

### id_generator

[`IDGeneratorResource`](../../../../../resources/interuss/id_generator.py) providing the Subscription ID for this scenario.

### planning_area

[`PlanningAreaResource`](../../../../../resources/astm/f3548/v21/planning_area.py) describes the 3D volume in which entities will be created.

## Setup test case

To perform this scenario, the area must be clear of test entities with the IDs we intend to use.

### Ensure clean workspace test step

#### [Clean any existing OIRs with known test IDs](../clean_workspace_op_intents.md)

#### [Clean any existing subscriptions with known test IDs](../clean_workspace_subs.md)

#### [Clean any existing constraint references with known test IDs](../clean_workspace_constraints.md)

This step ensures that the availability for the test identifier is set to `Unknown`.

#### [Availability can be requested](../fragments/availability/read.md)

#### [Availability can be set](../fragments/availability/update.md)

## Endpoint authorization test case

This test case ensures that the DSS properly authenticates requests to all its endpoints.

### Subscription endpoints authentication test step

it is in violation of **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0210,A2-7-2,7](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**.

#### ðŸ›‘ Delete constraint reference with invalid credentials check

If the DSS under test allows the deletion of a constraint reference with credentials that are well-formed but invalid,
it is in violation of **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0210,A2-7-2,7](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**.

#### ðŸ›‘ Delete constraint reference with missing scope check

If the DSS under test allows the deletion of a constraint reference with valid credentials but a missing scope,
it is in violation of **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0210,A2-7-2,7](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**.

#### ðŸ›‘ Delete constraint reference with incorrect scope check

If the DSS under test allows the deletion of a constraint reference with valid credentials but an incorrect scope,
it is in violation of **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0210,A2-7-2,7](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**.

#### ðŸ›‘ Delete constraint reference with valid credentials check

If the DSS does not allow the deletion of a constraint reference when valid credentials are presented,
it is in violation of **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,3](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**.

#### [Delete response format](../fragments/cr/crud/delete_format.md)

Check response format of a deletion.

#### ðŸ›‘ Search constraint references with missing credentials check

If the DSS under test allows searching for constraint references without any credentials being presented,
it is in violation of **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0210,A2-7-2,7](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**.

## Cleanup

### [Clean any existing OIRs with known test IDs](../clean_workspace_op_intents.md)

### [Clean any existing subscriptions with known test IDs](../clean_workspace_subs.md)

### [Clean any existing constraint references with known test IDs](../clean_workspace_constraints.md)

### [Availability can be requested](../fragments/availability/read.md)

### [Availability can be set](../fragments/availability/update.md)

The cleanup phase of this test scenario removes the subscription with the known test ID if it has not been removed before.
