# ASTM SCD DSS: Interfaces authentication test scenario

## Overview

Ensures that a DSS properly authenticates requests to all its endpoints.

Note that this does not cover authorization.

## Resources

### dss

[`DSSInstanceResource`](../../../../../resources/astm/f3548/v21/dss.py) to be tested in this scenario.

Note that to benefit from the maximum coverage, the DSS' AuthAdapterResource must be able to obtain credentials
for multiple scopes (so that a wrong scope may be used in place of the correct one) as well as an empty scope (that is, provide credentials where the scope is an empty string).

This scenario will check for the scope's availability and transparently ignore checks that can't be conducted.

Required scopes for running this scenario:

- `utm.strategic_coordination`

Optional scopes that will allow the scenario to provide additional coverage:

- `utm.availability_arbitration`
- `""` (empty string)

### id_generator

[`IDGeneratorResource`](../../../../../resources/interuss/id_generator.py) providing the Subscription ID for this scenario.

### planning_area

[`PlanningAreaResource`](../../../../../resources/astm/f3548/v21/planning_area.py) describes the 3D volume in which entities will be created.

## Setup test case

### [Ensure clean workspace test step](../clean_workspace.md)

This step ensures that the availability for the test identifier is set to `Unknown`.

#### [Availability can be requested](../fragments/availability/read.md)

#### [Availability can be set](../fragments/availability/update.md)

## Endpoint authorization test case

This test case ensures that the DSS properly authenticates requests to all its endpoints.

### Subscription endpoints authentication test step

#### ðŸ›‘ Unauthorized requests return the proper error message body check
