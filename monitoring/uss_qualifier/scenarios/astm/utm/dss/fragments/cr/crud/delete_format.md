# Delete constraint reference response format test step fragment

## ðŸ›‘ Delete constraint reference response format conforms to spec check

The response to a successful constraint reference deletion query is expected to conform to the format defined by the OpenAPI specification under the `A3.1` Annex of ASTM F3548âˆ’21.
