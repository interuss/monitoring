# Search constraint reference query test step fragment

This test step fragment validates that a query to search for constraint references with valid parameters succeeds.

## 🛑 Successful constraint reference search query check

If the DSS fails to let us search in the area for which the CR was created, it is failing to meet **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,3](../../../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**.
