The response to a successful get operational intent reference query is expected to conform to the format defined by the OpenAPI specification under the `A3.1` Annex of ASTM F3548âˆ’21.

If it does not, the DSS is failing to implement **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,1](../../../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**.

## ðŸ›‘ Get operational intent reference response content is correct check

A successful operational intent reference creation query is expected to return a body, the content of which reflects an operational intent reference that was created earlier.
If the content of the response does not correspond to what was requested, the DSS is failing to implement **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,1](../../../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**.
