# Search subscription query test step fragment

This test step fragment validates that a query to search for subscriptions succeeds.

## ðŸ›‘ Successful subscription search query check

If the DSS fails to let us search in the area for which the subscription was created, it is failing to meet **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,5](../../../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**.
