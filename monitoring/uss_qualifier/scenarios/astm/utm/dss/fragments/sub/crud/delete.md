# Delete subscription test step fragment

This test step fragment validates that subscriptions can be deleted.

## ðŸ›‘ Subscription can be deleted check

An attempt to delete a subscription when the correct version is provided should succeed, otherwise the DSS is in violation of **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,5](../../../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**.

## ðŸ›‘ Delete subscription response format conforms to spec check

The response to a successful subscription deletion query is expected to conform to the format defined by the OpenAPI specification under the `A3.1` Annex of ASTM F3548âˆ’21.

If it does not, the DSS is failing to implement **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,5](../../../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**.

## ðŸ›‘ Delete subscription response content is correct check

A successful subscription deletion query is expected to return a well-defined body, the content of which reflects the deleted subscription.

If the content of the response does not correspond to the subscription at the time of deletion, the DSS is failing to implement **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,5](../../../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**.
