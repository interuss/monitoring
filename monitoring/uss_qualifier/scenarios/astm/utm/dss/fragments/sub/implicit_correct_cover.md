# Implicit subscription cover validity test step fragment

This test step fragment validates the time-bounds of an implicit subscription
with respect to the OIRs it needs to cover.

## ðŸ›‘ Implicit subscription has wide enough temporal parameters check

If the implicit subscription's time boundaries do not cover every OIR attached to it, the DSS is in violation of **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0005,1](../../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**.
