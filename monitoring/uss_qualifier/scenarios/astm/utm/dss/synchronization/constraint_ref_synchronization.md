# ASTM SCD DSS: Constraint Reference Synchronization test scenario

## Overview

Verifies that all CRUD operations on constraint references performed on a given DSS instance
are properly propagated to every other DSS instance participating in the deployment.

## Resources

### dss

[`DSSInstanceResource`](../../../../../resources/astm/f3548/v21/dss.py) the DSS instance through which entities are created, modified and deleted.

### other_instances

[`DSSInstancesResource`](../../../../../resources/astm/f3548/v21/dss.py) pointing to the DSS instances used to confirm that entities are properly propagated.

### id_generator

[`IDGeneratorResource`](../../../../../resources/interuss/id_generator.py) providing the constraint reference ID for this scenario.

### planning_area

[`PlanningAreaResource`](../../../../../resources/planning_area.py) describes the 3D volume in which constraint reference will be created. Note that any start or end times specified in the underlying volume template
will be ignored.

### client_identity

[`ClientIdentityResource`](../../../../../resources/communications/client_identity.py) to be used for this scenario.

## Setup test case

### [Ensure clean workspace test step](../clean_workspace_constraints.md)

### [Verify secondary DSS instances are clean test step](../fragments/cr/verify_clean_secondary_workspace.md)

## CR synchronization test case

This test case creates an constraint reference on the main DSS, and verifies that it is properly synchronized to the other DSS instances.

It then goes on to mutate and delete it, each time confirming that all other DSSes return the expected results.

### Create CR validation test step

#### [CR can be created](../fragments/cr/crud/create.md)

#### [CR content is correct](../fragments/cr/validate/correctness.md)

### Retrieve newly created CR test step

Retrieve and validate synchronization of the created constraint at every DSS provided in `dss_instances`.

#### [CR can be read](../fragments/cr/crud/read_known.md)

#### ðŸ›‘ Newly created CR can be consistently retrieved from all DSS instances check

If the constraint retrieved from a secondary DSS instance is not consistent with the newly created one on the
primary DSS instance, this check will fail per **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0210,A2-7-2,1a](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**, **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0210,A2-7-2,1f](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**,
**[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0215](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)** and **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0020](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**.

#### [CR is synchronized](../fragments/cr/sync_get.md)

#### [CR Content is correct](../fragments/cr/validate/correctness.md)

#### [CR version is correct](../fragments/cr/validate/non_mutated.md)

### Search for newly created CR test step

Search for and validate synchronization of the created constraint at every DSS provided in `dss_instances`.

#### [CR can be searched for](../fragments/cr/crud/search_known.md)

#### ðŸ›‘ Newly created CR can be consistently searched for from all DSS instances check

If the constraint searched from a secondary DSS instance is not consistent with the newly created one on the
primary DSS instance, this check will fail per **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0210,A2-7-2,1a](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**, **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0210,A2-7-2,1e](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**,

#### [CR is synchronized](../fragments/cr/sync_search.md)

Confirm that each DSS returns the constraint in relevant search results.
Confirm that the constraint reference that was just created is properly synchronized across all DSS instances.

#### [CR content is correct](../fragments/cr/validate/correctness.md)

#### [CR version is correct](../fragments/cr/validate/non_mutated.md)

### Mutate CR test step

This test step mutates the previously created constraint reference to verify that the DSS reacts properly: notably, it checks that the constraint reference version is updated,
including for changes that are not directly visible, such as changing the constraint reference's footprint.

#### [CR can be mutated](../fragments/cr/crud/update.md)

#### [CR content is correct](../fragments/cr/validate/correctness.md)

#### [CR versions are correct](../fragments/cr/validate/mutated.md)

### Retrieve updated CR test step

Retrieve and validate synchronization of the updated constraint at every DSS provided in `dss_instances`.

#### [CR can be read](../fragments/cr/crud/read_known.md)

#### ðŸ›‘ Updated CR can be consistently retrieved from all DSS instances check

If the constraint retrieved from a secondary DSS instance is not consistent with the updated one on the
primary DSS instance, this check will fail per **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0210,A2-7-2,1b](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**, **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0210,A2-7-2,1d](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**,
**[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0215](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)** and **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0020](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**.

#### ðŸ›‘ Updated CR can be consistently searched for from all DSS instances check

If the constraint searched from a secondary DSS instance is not consistent with the updated one on the
primary DSS instance, this check will fail per **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0210,A2-7-2,1b](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**, **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0210,A2-7-2,1e](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**,

### Delete CR test step

Attempt to delete the constraint reference in various ways and ensure that the DSS reacts properly.

This also checks that the constraint reference data returned by a successful deletion is correct.

#### [CR can be deleted](../fragments/cr/crud/delete_known.md)

#### [CR content is correct](../fragments/cr/validate/correctness.md)

#### [CR versions are correct](../fragments/cr/validate/non_mutated.md)

#### ðŸ›‘ Deleted CR cannot be retrieved from all DSS instances check

If a DSS returns an constraint reference that was previously successfully deleted from the primary DSS,
either one of the primary DSS or the DSS that returned the constraint reference is in violation of **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0210,2a](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**, **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0210,A2-7-2,3b](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**,

#### [CR can be searched for](../fragments/cr/crud/search_query.md)

#### ðŸ›‘ Deleted CR cannot be searched for from all DSS instances check

If a DSS returns an constraint reference that was previously successfully deleted from the primary DSS,
either one of the primary DSS or the DSS that returned the constraint reference is in violation of **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0210,2a](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**, **[astm.f3548.v21.DSS0210,A2-7-2,3a](../../../../../requirements/astm/f3548/v21.md)**,
