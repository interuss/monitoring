# UFT Message Signing tests for SCD using uss_qualifier

UTM Field Test (UFT) has a requirement for USSes to sign their message requests
and responses in the SCD flow using IATF certificates provided by FAA.

This test suite helps to test the message signing by extending [suites.astm.utm.f3548_21](../../../astm/utm/f3548_21.yaml)
with scenarios that trigger reporting of message signing in the interactions with mock_uss.

## Test Setup

The test setup includes running the following components, as also shown in the [diagram](./InterUss_Test_Harness_With_Message_Signing.png)

1. uss_qualifier - This is the test driver that injects the operations for the SCD flow tests in USSes.
2. Auth - This auth server provides access tokens and the public key for token validation for USS-to-USS and USS-to-DSS communication. In a local deployment of the test infrastructure, this can be supplied by an instance of dummy auth running as a dockerized container exposing port 8085, as per build/dev/run_locally.sh.
3.  DSS - This is a DSS instance supporting SCD in the UTM environment defined by the auth server.  In a local deployment of the test infrastructure, this can be supplied by the local DSS instance running as a dockerized container exposing port 8082, as per build/dev/run_locally.sh.
4. Mock USS - This is an instance of the InterUSS monitoring tool mock_uss with scd and messagesigning capabilities enabled.  In a local deployment of the test infrastructure, this can be supplied by a local instance of mock_uss running as a dockerized container exposing port 8077, as per monitoring/mock_uss/run_locally_msgsigning.sh.
5. USS-under-Test - This is the USS that needs to be tested.
6. uss_qualifier interface. USSes need to develop an interface for their USS
to interface with the test harness. uss_qualifier will inject operations through this interface. The spec to
implement is - [Strategic Coordination Test Data Injection](../../../../../../interfaces/automated_testing/scd/v1/scd.yaml)

The main idea behind the tests is that mock_uss will consume and validate all the requests and responses from USS-under-test.

Note - As different USSes have different implementations, it could happen that you might need to create a subscription in the area of the flights.

## Steps to run the test

1. Set your uss_qualifier Interface implementation url in the [configuration file ](../../../../configurations/dev/message_signing.yaml) to run
the UFT message signing tests. If personal changes are needed, copy this yaml
file to a personal configuration file in the [personal configuration folder](../../../../configurations/personal), and edit this file instead.
The property to set is `resources.resource_declarations.flight_planners.specification.flight_planners.participant_id`
2. Run DSS and dummy-oauth using the script [run_locally.sh](../../../../../../build/dev/run_locally.sh)
    ```bash
    build/dev/run_locally.sh
    ```
3. Run mock_uss using the script [run_locally_msgsigning.sh]
    ```bash
   monitoring/mock_uss/run_locally_msgsigning.sh
    ```
4. Prepare your USS to run with
   1. The auth server used by the UTM ecosystem under test (dummy auth at http://localhost:8085/token or http://host.docker.internal:8085/token in a local deployment of the test infrastructure).
   2. A DSS instance supporting SCD in the UTM ecosystem under test (DSS at http://localhost:8082 or http://host.docker.internal:8085 in a local deployment of the test infrastructure).
5. Run the uss_qualifier interface for your USS.
6. Run uss_qualifier tests using script [run_locally.sh](../../../../../../monitoring/uss_qualifier/run_locally.sh) with config
    ```bash
   monitoring/uss_qualifier/run_locally.sh configurations.dev.faa.uft.local_message_signing
   ```

## Results
SCD tests report is generated under [uss_qualifier](../../../../../../monitoring/uss_qualifier).
The message signing results will be in the report created for the overall run - report.json. Failed message signing checks will show up as `FailedChecks` within the `FinalizeMessageSigningReport` test scenario.

### Positive tests -
A set of private/public keys are provided for use by mock_uss in message
signing analysis under the [build/test-certs/message-signing] folder.
This key pair, mock_faa_priv.pem/mock_faa_pub.der, is used by mock_uss
(when requested from an instance with the capability enabled) to sign its responses, and by `AuthAdapter` to sign requests of outgoing messages.
When the message signing mock_uss capability is enabled, the public key is served under the mock_uss endpoint
 /mock/msgsigning/.well-known/uas-traffic-management/pub.der,
 and can be retrieved by the USS under test in order for it to validate the
 mock_uss responses, per UFT message signing requirements. This public key was provided by the FAA
 and will pass SCVP validation for the UFT activity.

A USS should pass all the uss_qualifier tests in this suite. No failed checks indicate the USS-under-test message-signed all its requests and responses.


### Negative tests -
In the future, this test suite will be expanded to instruct mock_uss to replace the private/public keys with an invalid key pair by calling the appropriate endpoint. This will set the keypair to be `mock_priv.pem`/`mock_pub.der`. Using this keypair will lead to invalid signatures on mock_uss's interactions, and the `mock_pub.der` will not pass SCVP validation.
The USS-under-test should respond with 403 to all requests from mock_uss. The uss_qualifier tests will require this to happen and only pass if the correct behavior is demonstrated.
The message signing section of the report would show `403` in interactions with mock_uss.


### Other notes
Below are examples of valid http message signature headers. Malformed headers can cause validation to fail, for example providing an unreachable url within an `x5u`, or missing quotes in the `utm-message-signature-input` field.
