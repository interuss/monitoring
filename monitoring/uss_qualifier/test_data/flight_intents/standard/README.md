# Standard flight intents

This folder contains a set of standard flight intents intended to be used for various flight planning testing purposes, but they are built to be agnostic of location.  Specifically, the geographical features are defined at 0 latitude and 0 longitude with the expectation that these intents will be offset to the appropriate location when used.  They also assume ground level is at roughly 0m above the WGS-84 ellipsoid and so therefore should be offset in altitude as well.
