[atproxy](../../atproxy) is a webserver that "implements" [InterUSS automated testing interfaces](../../../interfaces/automated_testing) by queuing requests and expecting a backend process to retrieve (via periodic polling of atproxy) and fulfill those requests.  When this `atproxy_client` [mock_uss](..) functionality is enabled, mock_uss will act as this backend process, periodically polling an atproxy instance for outstanding requests, fulfilling those requests, and then posting the responses back to atproxy.
