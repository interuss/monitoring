When this `riddp` [mock_uss](..) functionality is enabled, mock_uss will behave like an RID Display Provider that makes remote ID information available to Display Application substitutes via the [InterUSS RID automated testing interface](../../../interfaces/automated_testing/rid) observation API.  Its Display Provider behavior can also be controlled via an ad-hoc interface.
