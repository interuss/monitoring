The [InterUSS geo-awareness automated testing API](../../../interfaces/automated_testing/geo-awareness) allows an automated test director (e.g., [uss_qualifier](../../uss_qualifier)) to instruct a USS to load geospatial data, and to ask the USS what geo-awareness information they know of that satisfy a set of specified criteria.  When this `geoawareness` [mock_uss](..) functionality is enabled, mock_uss will respond to these queries appropriately.
