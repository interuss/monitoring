# GitHub Pages tools

This folder contains tools to publish content to [this repository's GitHub Pages site](https://interuss.github.io/monitoring/).  Publishing is performed by [the CI](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) at appropriate times, generally when a PR is merged to the main branch.  Current site content is pushed to the gh-pages branch of this repository upon publishing, and then that content is deployed to the site by GitHub.
